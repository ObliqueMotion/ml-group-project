Team Members:
- Natalie Leon Guerrero
- Medina Lamkin
- Kallen Harvey
- Erik Nordin
- Scott Patterson

Lanugage choices:
- Pygame to implement the snake game
- Python to implement the ML models

Thoughts on inputs:
- General surroundings, openess of space, normalized angle from snake to apple, success of previous move
- Also possibly compare same model with simpler inputs

Quantify experiment success:
- Longest snake
- Accuracy: avg length of snake/number of epochs
- Number of epoch till convergence

Scope of the project:
- Create our own snake game
- Implement and compare 2 ML models
- Save resulting weights/data for each AI

List of suggested models to research:
- Neural Network
- NEAT Model
- Reinforcement Learning
-------------------------------------------------------------
To Do:
- Choose 2 machine learning models
  - Generalize inputs for each model
- Meet again Thursday @ 7:30pm
